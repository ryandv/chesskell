Chesskell
=========

LIVE DEMO: http://chess.ryandv.me

This is a personal learning project for Haskell. It exposes a simple chess AI using the minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning via a JSON API. Bitboards are used to speed up search times.

Kudos to [Josh](https://github.com/lime-green) for the awesome front-end user interface.
